# Madonna Generator

This project trained a variational auto encoder to generate images of the virgin mary and lets you explore its latent space. Based entirely on https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet

If you want to recreate this project I suggest you look at the IPython notebook.
Trained VAE for the full python version can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-eeq-6ygzLu7bupBqcgPCrIA7JnuGADF?usp=sharing and placed under the 'facenet' folder.
